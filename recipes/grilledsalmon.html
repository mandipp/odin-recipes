        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Salmon is an extremely healthy protein that many people tend to underrate,
            In addition to being a great source of protein, it also contains healthy fats
            and the popular 'omega-3' that is linked to improved brain health.
        </p>
        <p>Salmon is also extremely easy to prepare. Unlike some other types of meat, salmon
            requires very little marinade or spices on top. It still tastes delicious with
            just the basic seasoning - salt and pepper. But that doesn't mean you can't jazz it
            up a little. We will be using ginger and lime in addition to salt and pepper to
            lend out salmon a little more oomph.
